    "question": "Are dreams from God?",
    "answer": "Sometimes. God communicated through dreams to Joseph (Genesis 37, 40-41), Daniel (Daniel 2, 7), and others.  However, not all dreams are from God, as Jeremiah warns against false prophets who claim to receive divine messages through dreams (Jeremiah 23:25-32).\n"

    "question": "Are dreams from God trying to warn us?",
    "answer": "Sometimes. God communicated through dreams to Joseph (Genesis 37, 40-41), Daniel (Daniel 2, 7), and others, often revealing future events or warnings.  However, not all dreams are from God (Deuteronomy 13:1-5).  Scripture emphasizes discerning the source and interpreting dreams through God's revealed word.\n"
